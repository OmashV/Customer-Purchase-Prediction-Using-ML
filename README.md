# Customer Purchase Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a customer will make a purchase in the next 30 days using machine learning.  
It combines **data preprocessing, feature engineering (RFM, lifecycle, behavioral metrics), and predictive modeling** to provide business insights and recommendations.  

## ⚙️ Features
- Data preprocessing (missing values, encoding, feature engineering)  
- RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) feature creation  
- Logistic Regression and Random Forest modeling  
- Model evaluation with Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, and ROC-AUC  
- Feature importance analysis with SHAP for interpretability  
- Actionable business insights (customer segments, device analysis, city trends)  

## 📊 Results
- Best Model: **Random Forest** (highest ROC-AUC)  
- Top Features: Recency, Frequency, Spending, and Activity metrics  
- Insights: Recent activity and high spenders strongly predict purchases  
- Recommendations: Focus on retention, re-engagement, and personalized offers
